  // I want to be conservative with the versions of Python I am targetting for
  // my scripts, so that they are usable even on older versions of distros like
  // Ubuntu or Debian, which one can still come by on remote servers or inside
  // containers. However, static typing in Python has evolved a lot over the
  // last few years and gained lots of important features, which I don't want to
  // miss out on by targetting some ancient release of the language, so I have
  // to keep some balance with the choice of the minimal supported version.
  // Here's a short summary of major static typing-related features introduced
  // in recent Python updates:
  //
  // * Python 3.0 (2008) - syntax for annotating function parameters and return
  //   values is first added (PEP 3107)
  // * Python 3.5 (2015) - the built-in `typing` module is introduced (PEP 484)
  // * Python 3.6 (2016) - syntax for type annotations for variables and class
  //   fields (PEP 526)
  // * Python 3.8 (2019) - `Protocol` and structural subtyping is added to the
  //   built-in `typing` (PEP 544)
  // * Python 3.9 (2020) - generics can now be used on built-in types like
  //   `list` or `dict`, without requiring the use of `typing.List` and such
  //   (PEP 585)
  // * Python 3.10 (2021) - union types can be written as `X | Y` (PEP 604)
  // * Python 3.11 (2022) - the `Self` type and literal string types
  // * Python 3.12 (2023) - syntax for defining generics on classes and
  //   functions, also `type` keyword for defining type aliases (PEP 695)
