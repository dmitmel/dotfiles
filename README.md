# dotfiles

My dotfiles (configurations and settings) for shells, text editors and other terminal programs, plus
a collection of scripts. Written for and work on various UNIX-like OSes, primarily for:

- Arch Linux,
- Linux Mint,
- Ubuntu,
- macOS with GNU coreutils (i.e. BSDs are not supported),
- Android with Termux.

And also a legendary project that has survived for thousands of years of development.
